#### What's this?
A GPL WordPress framework for article based sites like blogs, magazines and more. It powers all of our themes and it has a couple of thousands active users: https://themeforest.net/user/tagdiv/portfolio 

The framework offers:
- An extended theme API (you can register from the theme, child theme or from external plugins: new blocks, single templates, category template, footer templates, header templates, modules, smart listas, thumbs with retina support, tinymce_formats and more)
- Custom Post Types support
- Custom metaboxes
- A custom made Options Panel
- Sidebar support for all templates
- and a lot of other features. We will write proper documentation soon!


#### How to use it?
- [The theme API](http://forum.tagdiv.com/the-theme-api/) - The API documentation
- To see how the framework is used, please have a look at our open source theme ionMag: https://github.com/tagDiv/ionMag
